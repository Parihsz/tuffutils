RobloxLibs is a collection of reusable modules I created while developing my game.
They are: 
* Lightweight. They are single file modules. Some contain red blox dependencies that you can easily swap out.
* The libraries are written to be concise and easy to read, allowing for easy customization.
* The performance sensitive ones have been optimized as much as possible. Though keep in mind they are modified to be more generalized for open source and can be optimized further for your specific usecase.
* Has niche modules that have never been made, but may have certain usecases.
* Can be built upon or used as full blown systems, allowing for quicker development time.
* The API was made to be easy to understand, use and can fit in most codebases.
* Fully typed with ``--!strict``
* Documented with examples and explanationsl.
* Updated regularly, fixing or improving current modules or adding new libraries.
